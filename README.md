The following project is a part of my summer internship during May 2020.
The project demanded the development of an **influencer marketing platform** through **MEAN stack development**.
My everyday responsibilities as an intern were to design and code the front end aspect of the website which required the use of AngularJS, Bootstrap, and AJAX. Following this I was required to code the back end with the use of NodeJS, ExpressJS, and few additional APIs such as that of Razorpay for payment gateway integration. A MySQL relational database was used for storing and retrieving information.
